## 🧩 Question 1: Two Sum  
**LeetCode Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### 📖 Problem Description  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### 💡 Approach  
- Start with an array of integers and a target value.  
- The goal is to find two numbers in the array whose sum equals the target.  
- Loop through each element of the array one by one.  
- For every element, check if there is another element such that both together make the target.  
- When found, note or display their indices.  
- The logic can be done using simple loops or by storing values and checking pairs.

### 🧾 Output Description  
Displays the indices of the two numbers that form the target sum, along with the numbers themselves.

## ⚙️ Question 225: Implement Stack using Queues  
**LeetCode Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

### 📖 Problem Description  
Implement a **stack** using **queues**. A stack follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle.

### 💡 Approach  
- Use two queues to create stack operations.  
- While pushing an element, add it to a new queue and move all existing elements behind it.  
- The front of the queue always represents the top of the stack.  
- For pop, remove the front element.  
- For top, show the front element without removing it.  
- For empty, check whether the queue is empty or not.

### 🧾 Output Description  
The program performs stack operations like push, pop, top, and empty, showing the updated stack status after each operation.
